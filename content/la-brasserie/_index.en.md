      When the Cuny brothers, Bernard and Daniel, acquired the Brasserie Le Noailles in 1986, they were aware that they must continue to uphold the reputation of this veritable Bordeaux institution, created in 1932 by the Homar couple.

      Originally from the south of france, Michel and Marcelle Homar had managed several restaurants there, including a certain “Noailles”…


      In 1932, the Homars decided to settle in Bordeaux and recreate their “Noailles” there. They set their sights on an old hardware store, on Allées de Tourny. This was the beginning of the Noailles that you know…


      In 1962, Micheline and Pascal Lagarde, Mrs. Homar's daughter and son-in-law, came to help her in the management of the Brasserie.

      After the death of Mrs. Homar in 1978, the Brasserie was put up for sale and several restaurateurs followed -Mr Regnaud then Mr Hias-, before the Cuny brothers took the reins in 1986. 


      Anne-Sophie, Bernard's daughter, ran the establishment for a few years before Nicolas, Daniel's son, took over in 2012. At his side, his sister Marion navigates between the bar and the kitchen.

      If Noailles today gives pride of place to regional dishes (Wilds mushrooms, Médoc “grenier” and other duck confits, etc.), one dish remains a fixture on the menu, in honor of its founder, Madame Homar's Choucroute !
