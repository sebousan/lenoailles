          'I can’t believe how good this is. I walked in by accident, business
          trip, Sunday night. Lovely Art Deco brasserie. Exceptional service
          (Franck): friendly, competent, unobtrusive. Traditional, perfectly
          executed fare (“grenier médocain” which is a sort of thinly sliced
          porked pie, followed by magret which was unbelievably well cooked - a
          rare feast. The house wine was the second from “Domaine de Chevalier”.
          I spent three days in Bordeaux last week, tried several restaurants,
          none even in the same league.'

          What a great place!! Asked to sit on the porch, found a great table by
          the window. Willy was our server, spoke English and had a wonderful
          personality. He helped make our time special here. Olives were put on
          the table to nibble on with our wine. Picked a wonderful bottle of
          wine with the help of Willy-Chateau Pernon Graves, blend of Merlot/Cab
          franc/cab. I had the goat cheese Salad, Husband-duck gizzard
          salad...they were big and delicious! I got the hake with vegetables
          and husband got the Blood Pudding...beautifully plated and delicious.
          Everything was Fantastic!!

          Fun lively eating experience. Very good food French cuisine and good

          Elegant, full of locals so not the ‘tourist trap’ as suggested by a
          previous review. I had the gravalax which was perfect, not too strong,
          followed by the calf’s liver, tender with a lovely slightly sweet
          shallot sauce. The frites were a treat. My friends have the house
          speciality of oysters and foie graswhich they enjoyed immensely, one
          then had the liver, the other the steak tartare. We each had a home
          made dessert, they have an excellent pastry chef! Would definitely
          recommend it and cannot wait to go again

          Fantastic traditional French Brassiere situated in central Bordeaux near
          the opera house. Very busy with locals we were glad to have been able
          to book a table. The welcome was warm, the staff friendly and
          attentive and the atmosphere lively but relaxed. The food quality was
          exceptional, portion sizes generous and prices reasonable given the
          overall quality. The drinks selection was wide with a couple of
          special gems. Well worth a visit
